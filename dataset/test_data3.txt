Although single or concurrent use of DRUGA and DRUGB has some anti proliferative effects , the sequential administrations of both drugs remarkably enhanced anti tumor activity .















When cells were exposed to DRUGA followed by DRUGB , synergism was observed .















The molecular basis of this synergism is that the signaling pathways that were initially activated by DRUGA exposure were efficiently suppressed by the subsequent exposure to DRUGB .

The role of pdgdg ( Kipdg ) in DRUGA enhanced DRUGB cytotoxicity in human ovarian cancer cells .

HEY cells treated with DRUGA plus DRUGB formed fewer colonies than did cells treated with either agent alone .















Treatment of HEY xenograft bearing mice with DRUGA plus DRUGB inhibited tumor growth more than treatment with either agent alone ( average tumor volume per mouse , DRUGN + DRUGN vs DRUGN : dg.dgdg vs. dg.dgdg cmdg , difference = dg.dgdg cmdg , dgdg % confidence interval [ CI ] = dg.dgdg to dg.dgdg cmdg , P = .dgdgdg ) ;

DRUGA + DRUGB vs .















The siRNA knockdown of pdgdg ( Kipdg ) decreased DRUGA and DRUGB induced apoptosis compared with a negative control siRNA ( sub Gdg fraction , control siRNA vs. pdgdg ( Kipdg ) siRNA : dgdg.dg % vs. dgdg.dg % , difference = dgdg.dg % , dgdg % CI = dgdg.dg % to dgdg.dg % , P = .dgdgdg ) .















Studies with forced expression and siRNA knockdown of Bcl dg and Cdkdg suggest that DRUGA mediated induction of pdgdg ( Kipdg ) enhanced DRUGB induced apoptosis by negatively regulating Bcl dg and Cdkdg expression .















Inhibition of Src family and Abl kinases with either siRNAs or DRUGA enhances DRUGB sensitivity of ovarian cancer cells through pdgdg ( Kipdg ) mediated suppression of Bcl dg and Cdkdg expression .

DRUGA antagonize the effects of DRUGB .















DRUGA in the presence of increased intraocular pressure may be hazardous when taken concurrently with agents such as DRUGB .















DRUGA may affect gastrointestinal absorption of various drugs , such as slowly dissolving dosage forms of DRUGB ;















DRUGA may antagonize the effects of drugs that alter gastrointestinal motility , such as DRUGB .















Because DRUGA may interfere with the absorption of DRUGB , simultaneous use of these drugs should be avoided .
